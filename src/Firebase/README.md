# Firebase Init Instructions

This document will include instructions on all things firebase in the Western Australian Debating Legue!!

## Firebase Emulators 
This project will inlcude the emulators for
---
1. Firestore 
2. Authentication 
3. Functions
4. Storage

The project will get the use of extensions added in later, when it becomes more 
definitive the extenions we need, these can be installed by running the command 
> firebase ext:install <publisherId/extensionId>

To start the emualtors run:
> firebase emulators:start

This will provide you with a gui of what is going on like your using the online version, to access this please follow the link that comes up in your terminal. If the link doesn't show in the terminal, this is the default link:
> localhost:4000

I have added in the basic Auth and Firestore emualtors, and will decide later if any more need to be added
