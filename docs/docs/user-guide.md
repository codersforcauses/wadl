The WADL Application is currently `in development` and the released version is in beta stage, which may result in unexpected bugs.

## Creating a Team Coordinator Account

To create a user account, simply follow the registration process. Once you have completed the necessary information, your account will be pending approval by an administrator. Please allow up to `1-3 business days` for approval. Note that you will not receive any notification once your account has been approved. This feature is under development.

## Setting Up Your Institution

Before registering your teams for a tournament, you'll need to create a `School Profile`. If there are multiple team coordinators, this profile may have already been created. You can select your school profile from the school name dropdown menu, or create a new profile by typing the school name and filling in the rest of the information. To link your account with the school profile, make sure to submit any changes you make.

Information required:

1. `School Name`: A name that represents your school
2. `School Name Abbreviation`: A short name that represents your school
3. `School Email`: A contact email for WADL staff
4. `School Phone Number`: A phone number for WADL staff

Once your school profile has been created, you'll have access to the `Team Registration` button in the navigation dropdown menu and the `Teams` page.

## Team Registration

It is advised that you only use one team coordinator to register your teams in order to prevent duplications. Upon completion, all team coordinators associated with the same institution will be able to view the registered teams on the `Teams` page.

Additionally, you'll have the option to edit preferences for each team individually and even add more teams after your initial registration, providing you with a flexible and organized system for managing your teams.

Information required:

1. `Tournament Name`: A list of tournament that are currently open for registration will be displayed in a dropdown menu
2. `Level`: Select the levels you want to participate in (Novice, Junior, Senior)
3. `Number of Teams`: Indicate the total number of teams for each level
4. `Week Preference`: Specify which week you would prefer to compete in (Week 1, Week 2, Either) for each level.
5. `Tuesday Allocation`: Choose the number of teams you would like to compete on a Tuesday for each level
6. `Wednesday Allocation`: Choose the number of teams you would like to compete on a Wednesday for each level. Note: You can allocate teams for both Tuesday and Wednesday.
7. `Venue Preferences`: Provide your top 3 venue preferences or indicate if you have no preference
8. `Notes`: Any additional notes you might like to include for WADL staff
